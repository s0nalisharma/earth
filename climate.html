	<div>What if you wake up one morning to see a world you did not recognize. Outside, there are no trees, no grass, with a sky full of buildings. You look beyond them to see a grey, foggy background.  As your eyes explore this new environment, you inhale something that makes your chest ache. Welcome, to a future with climate change untouched. Currently, our planet still has a chance to avoid that future. If we decreased the amount of carbon dioxide produced by 2075, then we could be alright. To save Earth, we need to switch our energy source from fossil fuels to renewable (green) energy.
	<br>
	<br>
	Climate change is the result of all the carbon dioxide in the air. It has already affected us in many ways, from the dying coral reefs and rising sea levels to the increase in global temperatures. A 2018 United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (U.N.) report said that we would “require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.” Some changes include reducing 45% of the carbon emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2075. Many carbon dioxide removal measures would have to be made, for example, planting “forests the size of Canada.” In addition to that, capturing carbon and storing it, a process that traps carbon dioxide and prevents it from entering the atmosphere. “Examples of actions include shifting to low-or-zero-emission on power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure, the report said. 85% of the energy would also have to be renewable, and the use of coal would need to stop (Katie Reilly, Time).
	<br>
	<br>
	Many people, when they think about renewable energy, their minds immediately go to how great it is. As soon as they research the cost, however, they see how expensive it is and get discouraged. What people do not know is that prices of renewable energy are falling according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency(IRENA) in 2017. The cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity has fallen by 73% and onshore wind electricity by 23% since 2010. The prices of fossil fuels are $0.05-$0.17 per kWh(kilowatt-hour).
	<br>
	<br>
	On the other hand, solar energy is $0.10 per kWh and wind is $0.04-$0.06 per kWh. Therefore renewable energy can be cheaper than fossil fuels. “These cost declines across technologies are unprecedented and representative to the degree to which renewable energy is disrupting the global energy system.” the director-general of IRENA, Adnan Amin, said. Besides cost declines, there are also many benefits to renewable energy sources. For instance, green energy releases no greenhouse gases. Renewable energy reduces our dependence on fossil fuels (that will eventually run out). Also, it reduces air pollution and gives us a diverse energy supply. That is solar, wind, biogas, geothermal, biomass, hydroelectricity, as well as wave and tidal power. All these different sources create jobs in manufacturing and insulation (Dominic Dudley, Forbes). In other words, renewable energy is a better and more beneficial option for power.
	<br>
	<br>
	All of these different sources can incorporate into our society in many ways, including our infrastructure and transportation. Buildings account for 35% of the electricity consumption in the U.S. Many developers or building owners hesitate about going green because of the cost. On the contrary, multiple studies have shown that environmentally sustainable buildings have higher rental rates, occupancy rates, and lower utility and operational costs. “Studies of green commercial buildings have shown a significant decrease in water, heating, cooling, and electricity bills, with some office buildings reporting savings of $1 million per year in electricity costs alone.” (Razin Ely, Forbes) According to the Green Education Foundation in Massachusetts, rainwater collects on rooftops saving about 100 million gallons of water every year for flushing toilets and cooling systems (Ely Razin, Forbes).  Transportation wise,  "These vehicles use a different kind of fuel and plug into our electricity system, and the good news about that is that there are several cost-benefit studies that are showing this can be beneficial to all ratepayers, not just the drivers of the vehicles," said Matt Stanberry, the managing director of  Advanced Energy Economy about electric cars. Electric cars have numerous amounts of benefits from not realizing gas into the atmosphere and decreasing the carbon footprint to, saving money.  These are just two of the ways renewable energy could incorporate into our society for a greener Earth.
	<br>
	<br>
	However, renewable energy has some problems. Some sources are highly dependent on weather, and this could affect the amount of electricity produced, resulting in a disaster. On top of that, some energy sources are not available in all areas, like hydropower is insufficient in places without bodies of water. Vast fields are also required to produce renewable energy. Some renewable energy like solar and wind is believed not to be needed, according to a 2018 Forbes article. So far, no nation had created a carbon-free electricity supply out of solar and wind energy. Adding solar panels and wind turbines in large quantities increases the cost of generating electricity, and it is unreliable. These are two of the oldest sources having been around since the 1800s. In 2016 solar energy made up only 1.3% and wind 3.9% of the planet's electricity supply. $300 billion are invested globally per year, but it is not worth it.
	<br>
	<br>
 	The country with the most expensive electricity is Denmark; Its amount is 48% wind and 3% solar. Even though wind and solar may be costly, there are still other forms of energy like nuclear and hydropower. Nations like Norway, Brazil, Costa Rica are almost entirely decarbonized with hydropower. France has one of the least amounts of carbon emissions, with 88% of its energy being carbon-free- 72% is nuclear and 10% hydropower(Michael Shellenberger, Forbes). The good thing, however, is that all these things can be changed. Renewable energy is built to produce electricity at faster rates in smaller areas. There are also so many types of renewable energy sources that location shouldn't matter hugely. Thus renewable energy is still an option for the future that we must consider and use.
	<br>
	<br>
	Imagine waking up to a bright and sunny day. Outside there is a clear blue sky with white puffy clouds that remind you of fluffy cotton. As you look around at all the houses with roofs full of solar panels, you see windmills in the distance. As you walk to your mailbox, you hear the chirps of the birds in the trees. Everywhere there are trees and plants. You breathe in air that makes you feel good and clean. Welcome to a future without climate change. As you just imagined, a big step to reaching that future is with renewable energy sources. Renewable energy has many benefits and can be used to help our planet. The cost will no longer be a problem as prices are decreasing. Even today, many people save money with renewable energy sources. Switching to renewable energy will save the planet. Renewable energy is the key to a clean future.
